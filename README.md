# ipsets
Manual and automatic managed interface for ipset

Features:

* Blacklist individual IPs, IP CIDRs, Domains, ASNs, countries, or entire local or remote blocklists
* Override Blacklists with Whitelists
* Implemented as a systemd service with systemd timer update schedule
* Caches blocklists and only downloads updates when new content is found
* rsyslog entry to keep syslog cleaner and redirect messages to separate log file
* logrotate entry to manage log files

Originally based, in part, on [Skynet](https://github.com/Adamm00/IPSet_ASUS) by Adamm00, a very useful ipset firewall for Asus routers running AsusWRT-Merlin firmware.
